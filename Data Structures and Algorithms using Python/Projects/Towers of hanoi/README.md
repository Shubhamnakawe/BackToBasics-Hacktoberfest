# Description-

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. 
It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. 
The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

**This Project is Implemented using Stacks.**

# Steps to run the code samples-

 1. Download Python from [official site](https://github.com/mahawiki/BackToBasics-Hacktoberfest/tree/main/Python-basics-in-10-programs).
 2. Then from command prompt **cd into this directory**.
 3. Since Python is an interpreter, we don't have to compile these programs.
 4. To run programs- **python script.py**.
