# Steps to run the code samples-

 1. Download Python from [official site](https://github.com/mahawiki/BackToBasics-Hacktoberfest/tree/main/Python-basics-in-10-programs).
 2. Then from command prompt **cd into this directory**.
 3. Since Python is an interpreter, we don't have to compile these programs.
 4. To run programs- **python program_name.py**.
